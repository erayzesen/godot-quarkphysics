## Features of the Extension:

* Covers the entire API of the physics engine and can be easily used with the engine's up-to-date [documentation](https://erayzesen.github.io/QuarkPhysics/documentation/).
* Can render QMeshNode objects with various advanced settings.
* Includes `QMeshEditor` plugin for editing QMeshAdvancedNode objects.
* Supports all platforms provided by Godot's GDExtension.
* Includes example projects created with QuarkPhysics.

## How to Use? 
You can use it like other Godot 4 native extension and plugins. Simply download the latest version from the Releases section and add the `addons` folder to your project as is. If you want to use the `QMeshEditor` plugin, make sure it is activated in Godot's project settings.

Additionally, you can check out the example scenes and applications in the `examples` folder. If you don't need them, there's no need to add anything other than the `addons` folder to your project.


## How to Contribute?
You can contribute to the project in many ways. At this stage, the most valuable contribution is to test the project and report any bugs you encounter. You can also share your experiences. Additionally, you can help by working on documentation, creating tutorials, or promoting the project.

If you use QuarkPhysics in one of your game projects, please donâ€™t forget to let me know at erayzesen@gmail.com. This would be a significant contribution to the showcase we plan to present soon.
