		QSoftBodyNode is a body type that defines deformable, soft objects in the physics world. Mass-spring model is used for simulation dynamics in soft bodies. In the mass-spring model, there are particles with mass that can move individually and interact with the physics world, and these particles can be connected to each other with spring constraints. Additionally, with some user-configurable options specific to the simulation, particles can be subjected to constraints obtained from some calculations. For example, you can add a constraint that ensures particles remain faithful to their initially defined local positions using the "shape matching" option. You can apply a constraint that gives the feeling that the polygon are filled with gas and maintains their area using the "area preserving" option. You can use options that allow particles to collide with each other with a specific radius, and create objects called PBD (Position Based Dynamics). QSoftBody objects inherently require a more flexible configuration than other body types and contain many options.

		<method name="get_target_preservation_area">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_area_preserving_enabled">
			<return type="QSoftBodyNode" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Sets whether the area preserving option is enabled of the body. If the area preserving option is enabled, the total area of the polygon are calculated at each physics step, and forces are applied to the particles that define the boundaries of the polygon to achieve a total area that can be determined by the user. If the user does not specify, when this option is enabled, the target area is calculated based on the original positions of the polygon particles, in other words, the total area of undeformed polygons are set as the target area.
				[param value]: A value to set.

			<description>
				Sets whether the particle-spesific mass option is enabled for the body. If this option is set to true, particles will continue to move with the mass defined for the body, but a specific mass value provided by you will be used for collision and constraint calculations.  In most case, you don't want the mass value defined for the entire soft body object to be used for individual particle collision and constraint responses. Instead, you can define a specific particle mass value by dividing the mass value of the body by the number of particles, for example.
