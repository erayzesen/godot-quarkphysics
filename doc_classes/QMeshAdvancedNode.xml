	QMeshAdvancedNode allows you to create custom and advanced meshes directly within the editor using the QMeshEditor plugin. Additionally, it enables you to export and import your meshes in a JSON-based format.
	[b]Note:[/b] These helper types of QMeshNode, once added to the scene, are converted into a typical QMeshNode with particles, spring connections, UV mappings, and a polygon. After being added to the scene, all modifications and adjustments should be done using the general methods of QMeshNode, rather than the member properties defined here.
